This is a copy of GF's official .NET runtime:

- source: https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-core/tree/master/src/runtime/dotNet 
- documentation: http://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/runtime-api.html#csharp

with the following changes:

- The target framework has been updated to .NET Framework 4.8 (the latest available at this time).

- The native DLLs (`gu.dll` and `pgf.dll`) are included for convenience.
